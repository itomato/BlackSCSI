# Build Your Own

These instructions will guide you through purchasing all of the parts needed to assemble kits for yourselves and for friends! Please note the hardware is licensed non-commercial.

If you'd like to buy the kits pre-packaged/pre-flashed or fully assembled we have a network of makers here to help you out at https://scsi.blue

## Order Parts

Updated for 1.0-c.

### PCB's

Grab the latest Gerbers. Gerber files tell the PCB manufacturer how to create the BlueSCSI boards.

### BluePill

Buy from a place where returns are easy. Ensure the photo in the listing shows a chip that says STM32 on it.

The BluePill must be a STM32F103**C8T6** - a C6T6 will not work. Check the listings closely.
