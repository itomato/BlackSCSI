# BlueSCSI 1.0-b to 1.0-c
:toc: macro

## Introduction

1.0-c was a small change to fix an issue with machines that provide low or no `TERMPOWER` over the SCSI bus. If you received a fully-assembled BlueSCSI after April 1st, 2021 then this was done for you. If you have a kit labeled 1.0-b you can make these modifications to become a 1.0-c.

## Steps

### Disconnect `TERMPOWER` from 220 Pull Up Jumper

Use a cutting tool to cut the small trace between the `TERMPOWR` and 220 Pull Up Jumper pictured below.

Make sure continuity from `TERMPOWER` to the diode still flows correctly but is disconnected from the jumper.

### Connect 5V to 220 Pull Up Jumper

Now we will provide pull up from the 5V provided by the BluePill.

### Complete!

Thatâ€™s it! 5V to the Pull Up resistors will now work when powered externally.
